Following up on our last meeting about surrealism, today we'll talk about realism. Realism reveals the phenomena that occur in this world. For example, we can see from a natural fact of life experienced objectively and real. As a refutation of realism, static classicism and romanticism were mainly supported by the rise of the socialist era in the 17-18th centuries.<br /><em><strong>narrator</strong></em>: <br />What is the topic of the talk?</p>\n<p>In your test book, you will read:<br />A.

The conclusion, detailed in the December issue of the journal Antiquity, challenges earlier than 4,600 years ago, while the smaller bluestones were imported from Wales later, a new study timelines that proposed the smaller stones were raised first.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"The sequence proposed for the site is really the wrong way around,\" said study co-author Timothy Darvill, an archaeologist at Bournemouth University in England. \"The original idea that it starts small and gets bigger is wrong. It starts big and stays big. The new scheme puts the big stones at the center at the site as the first stage.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The new timeline, which relies on statistical methods to tighten the dates when the stones were prea of Stonehenge. Instead, a few generations likely built each of the major elements of the site, put into place, overturns the notion that ancient societies spent hundreds of years building each said Robert Ixer, a researcher who discovered the origin of the bluestones, but who was not involved in the study. \"It's a very timely paper and a very important paper,\" Ixer said. \"A lot of us have got to go back and rethink when the stones arrived.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Mysterious Monument</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Wiltshire, England, site of Stonehenge is one of the world's most enduring mysteries. No one knows why prehistoric people built the enigmatic megaliths, although researchers over the years have argued the site was originally a sun calendar, a symbol of unity, or a burial monument.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; Though only some of the stones remain, at the center of the site once sat an oval of bluestones, or igneous rocks (those formed from magma) that turn a bluish hue when wet or freshly cut. Surrounding the bluestones are five giant sandstone megaliths called trilithons, or two vertical standing slabs capped by a horizontal stone, arranged in the shape of a horseshoe.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Around the horseshoe, ancient builders erected a circular ring of bluestones. The sandstone boulders, or sarsens, can weigh up to 40 tons (36,287 kilograms), while the much smaller bluestones weigh a mere 4 tons (3,628 kg). Past researchers believed the bluestone oval and circle were erected earlier than the massive sandstone horseshoe. But when Darvill and his colleagues began excavations at the site in 2008, they found the previous chronology didn't add up. The team estimated the age of new artifacts from the site, such as an antler bone pick stuck within the stones. Combining the new information with dating from past excavations, the team created a new timeline for Stone-henge's construction.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like past researchers, the team believes that ancient people first used the site 5,000 years ago, when they dug a circular ditch and mound, or henge, about 361 feet (110 meters) in diameter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But the new analysis suggests around 2600 B.C. the Neolithic people built the giant sandstone horseshoe, drawing the stone from nearby quarries.

The conclusion, detailed in the December issue of the journal Antiquity, challenges earlier than 4,600 years ago, while the smaller bluestones were imported from Wales later, a new study timelines that proposed the smaller stones were raised first.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"The sequence proposed for the site is really the wrong way around,\" said study co-author Timothy Darvill, an archaeologist at Bournemouth University in England. \"The original idea that it starts small and gets bigger is wrong. It starts big and stays big. The new scheme puts the big stones at the center at the site as the first stage.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The new timeline, which relies on statistical methods to tighten the dates when the stones were prea of Stonehenge. Instead, a few generations likely built each of the major elements of the site, put into place, overturns the notion that ancient societies spent hundreds of years building each said Robert Ixer, a researcher who discovered the origin of the bluestones, but who was not involved in the study. \"It's a very timely paper and a very important paper,\" Ixer said. \"A lot of us have got to go back and rethink when the stones arrived.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Mysterious Monument</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Wiltshire, England, site of Stonehenge is one of the world's most enduring mysteries. No one knows why prehistoric people built the enigmatic megaliths, although researchers over the years have argued the site was originally a sun calendar, a symbol of unity, or a burial monument.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; Though only some of the stones remain, at the center of the site once sat an oval of bluestones, or igneous rocks (those formed from magma) that turn a bluish hue when wet or freshly cut. Surrounding the bluestones are five giant sandstone megaliths called trilithons, or two vertical standing slabs capped by a horizontal stone, arranged in the shape of a horseshoe.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Around the horseshoe, ancient builders erected a circular ring of bluestones. The sandstone boulders, or sarsens, can weigh up to 40 tons (36,287 kilograms), while the much smaller bluestones weigh a mere 4 tons (3,628 kg). Past researchers believed the bluestone oval and circle were erected earlier than the massive sandstone horseshoe. But when Darvill and his colleagues began excavations at the site in 2008, they found the previous chronology didn't add up. The team estimated the age of new artifacts from the site, such as an antler bone pick stuck within the stones. Combining the new information with dating from past excavations, the team created a new timeline for Stone-henge's construction.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like past researchers, the team believes that ancient people first used the site 5,000 years ago, when they dug a circular ditch and mound, or henge, about 361 feet (110 meters) in diameter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But the new analysis suggests around 2600 B.C. the Neolithic people built the giant sandstone horseshoe, drawing the stone from nearby quarries. Only then did builders arrange the much smaller bluestones, which were probably imported from Wales. Those bluestones were then rearranged at various positions throughout the site over the next millennium, Darvill said. \"They sort out the local stuff first, and then they bring in the stones from Wales to add to the complexity of the structure Darvill told LiveScience.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; The new dating allows the archaeologists to tie the structure to specific people who lived in the area at the time, Darvill said. The builders of the larger sandstone structures were pig farmers found only in the British Isles. In contrast, the bluestone builders would've been the Beaker people, sheep and cow herders who lived throughout Europe and are known for the distinctive, bell-shape pottery they left behind. The new timeline \"connects everything together, it gives us a good sequence of events outside, and it gives us a set of cultural associations with the different stages of construction,\" <br />Darvill said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The word antler has the defin&iacute;tion that...</p>",

Mandela's grandfather was the ruler of the Thembu people and his father was a local chief.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mandela was the first person in his family to attend school (both of his parents were illiterate). On the first day of school, a teacher at the Methodist mission school, Miss Mdingane, re-named him Nelson. Nelson did well in school and went on to graduate from college and attend law school at University of the Witwatersrand (Mandela was the only black African student in his class). Mandela once said, \"Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By 1942, Mandela was involved in political causes. He began attending meetings of the African National Congress (ANC), a revolutionary group whose aim was to fight apartheid (laws establishing racial separation and oppression in South Africa).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mandela helped found the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) in 1944. He organized boycotts and strikes to fight for voting rights and equality for black South Africans. In 1944, he married Evelyn Ntoko Mase (they had 4 children).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1956, Mandela and over 100 associates of his, were arrested for treason. They were all later acquitted. Mandela divorced Evelyn in 1958, then married Nomzamo Winnie Madikizela (with whom he had 2 children).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ANC was banned in South Africa in 1960. In 1964, Mandala was sentenced to life in prison for fighting apartheid. After spending 27 years in prison, Mandela was released in 1990. Upon his release, Mandela worked to repeal apartheid and stop the growing violence in South Africa. He also helped establish multiracial elections which would occur in 1994. For his work, Mandela won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 (he shared the prize with F. W. de Klerk, who was then the President of South Africa).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1994, South Africa held its first truly democratic, non-racial election and chose Nelson Mandela as its president. Mandela championed reconciliation, the peaceful resolution of grievances after decades of repressive laws against black South Africans. Without Mandela's guidance, South Africa might have lapsed into a bloody civil war.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mandela published his autobiography, \"Long Walk to Freedom, in 1994. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was formed in 1995 (it was chaired by Archbishop Desmond Tutu). The Commission was a court-like organization that was formed in order to document the attrocities that the African apartheid police state had perpetrated against black people, and thus begin to heal the rift that had formed between the races in South Africa and avoid a civil war.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Freedom Day, celebrated on April 27 each year, commemorates the anniversary of South Africa's first real democratic elections (in which Mandela was elected as the president).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mandela served as President of South Africa until 1999 (he refused a second term). On his 80th birthday, he married Gra&ccedil;a Machel (he had divorced Winnie in 1996). His second book, \"Conversations with Myself,\" was published in 2010.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nelson Mandela died on December 5, 2013, at the age of 95. He died of natural causes after a long illness. He will be remembered as one of the greatest peace-makers and statesmen of all time.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When did Nelson Mandela get divorced for the second time ?</p>",

There are two principal influences that shape the terrain: constructive processes such as uplift, which create new landscape features, and destructive forces such as erosion, which gradually wear away exposed landforms.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hills and mountains are often regarded as the epitome of permanence, successfully resisting the destructive forces of nature, but in fact they tend to be relatively short-lived in geological terms. As a general rule, the higher a mountain is, the more recently it was formed; for example, the high mountains of the Himalayas are only about 50 million years old. Lower mountains tend to be older, and are often the eroded relics of much higher mountain chains. About 400 million years ago, when the present-day continents of North America and Europe were joined, the Caledonian mountain chain was the same size as the modern Himalayas. Today, however, the relics of the Caledonian orogeny (mountain-building period) exist as the comparatively low mountains of Greenland, the northern Appalachians in the United States, the Scottish Highlands, and the Norwegian coastal plateau.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Earth's crust is thought to be divided into huge, movable segments, called plates, which float on a soft plastic layer of rock. Some mountains were formed as a result of these plates crashing into each other and forcing up the rock at the plate margins. In this process, sedimentary rocks that originally formed on the seabed may be folded upwards to altitudes of more than 26,000 feet. Other mountains may be raised by earthquakes, which fracture the Earth's crust and can displace enough rock to produce block mountains. A third type of mountain may be formed as a result of volcanic activity which occurs in regions of active fold mountain belts, such as in the Cascade Range of western North America. The Cascades are made up of lavas and volcanic materials. Many of the peaks are<br />extinct volcanoes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whatever the reason for mountain formation, as soon as land rises above sea level it is subjected to destructive forces. The exposed rocks are attacked by the various weather processes and gradually broken down into fragments, which are then carried away and later deposited as sediments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus, any landscape represents only a temporary stage in the continuous battle between the forces of uplift and those of erosion. The weather, in its many forms, is the main agent of erosion. Rain washes away loose soil and penetrates cracks in the rocks. Carbon dioxide in the air reacts with the rainwater, forming a weak acid (carbonic acid) that may chemically attack the rocks. The rain seeps underground and the water may reappear later as springs. These springs are the sources of streams and rivers, which cut through the rocks and carry away debris from the mountains to the lowlands.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Under very cold conditions, rocks can be shattered by ice and frost. Glaciers may form in permanently cold areas, and these slowly moving masses of ice cut out valleys, carrying with them huge quantities of eroded rock debris. In dry areas the wind is the principal agent of erosion. It carries fine particles of sand, which bombard exposed rock surfaces, thereby wearing them into yet more sand. Even living things contribute to the formation of landscapes. Tree roots force their way into cracks in rocks and, in so doing, speed their splitting.

Nicotine, however, is only a small component of cigarette smoke, which contains more than 4,700 chemical compounds, including 43 cancer-causing substances.

The study suggests that people who smoke cigarettes are continually damaging their cardiovascular system, which adapts in order to compensate for the effects of smoking. It further states that people who do not smoke do not have the benefit of their system adapting to the smoke inhalation. Consequently, the effects of passive smoking are far greater on non-smokers than on smokers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This report emphasizes that cancer is not caused by a single element in cigarette smoke; harmful effects to health are caused by many components. Carbon monoxide, for example, competes with oxygen in red blood cells and interferes with the blood's ability to deliver life-giving oxygen to the heart. Nicotine and other toxins in cigarette smoke activate small blood cells called platelets, which increases the likelihood of blood clots, thereby affecting blood circulation throughout the body.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The researchers criticize the practice of some scientific consultants who work with the tobacco industry for assuming that cigarette smoke has the same impact on smokers as it does on non-smokers. They argue that those scientists are underestimating the damage done by passive smoking and, in support of their recent findings, cite some previous research which points to passive smoking as the cause for between 30,000 and 60,000 deaths from heart attacks each year in the United States. This means that passive smoking is the third most preventable cause of death after active smoking and alcohol-related diseases</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The study argues that the type of action needed against passive smoking should be similar to that being taken against illegal drugs and AIDS (SIDA). The UCSF researchers maintain that the simplest and most cost-effective action is to establish smoke-free work places, schools and public places.</p>\n<p>The word adverse is closest in meaning with ....</p>",

A few months ago, Airbus unveiled a major cost-cutting programme aiming to reduce the workforce in Europe by 10,000, as well as announcing a group restructuring. \"I can tell you with full confidence that Airbus is back and fully back, as you have started noting yesterday as demonstrated by our first day announcements,\" said Mr Gallois on the second day of the air show.</p>\n<p>However, Boeing also announced a deal with General Electric (GE) on the show's first day.

Therefore, the term food web is a better description of food relationship than the term food chain. A food web is a complex feeding systems that contains several food chains. For example, mice, rabbits and deer eat plants. Owls eat meat and rabbits. Mountain lion eats rabbits and deer.

Such impacts continue to pose a natural hazard to life on Earth. In the twentieth century, large meteorite objects are known to have collided with Earth. If an impact is large enough, it can disturb the environment of the entire Earth and cause an ecological catastrophe. The best-documented such impact took place 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period of geological history. This break in Earth's history is marked by a mass extinction, when as many as half the species on the planet became extinct. While there are a dozen or more mass extinctions in the geological record, the Cretaceous mass extinction has always in- trigued paleontologists because it marks the end of the age of the dinosaurs. For tens of millions of<br />years, those great creatures had flourished. Then, suddenly, they disappeared.</p>\n<p>The body that impacted Earth at the end of the Cretaceous period was a meteorite with a mass of more than a trillion tons and a diameter of at least 10 kilometers. Scientists first identified this impact in 1980 from the worldwide layer of sediment deposited from the dust cloud that enveloped the planet after the impact. This sediment layer is enriched in the rare metal iridium and other elements that are relatively abundant in a meteorite but very rare in the crust of Earth. Even diluted by the terrestrial material excavated from the crater, this component of meteorites is easily identified. By 1990 geologists had located the impact site itself in the Yucat&aacute;n region of Mexico. The crater, now deeply buried in sediment, was originally about 200 kilometers in diameter.</p>\n<p>This impact released an enormous amount of energy, excavating a crater about twice as large as the lunar crater Tycho.
